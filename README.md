It's a chrome extension I use mostly to study Japanese while watching Anime. My mpv player copies the current displayed subtitle to the clipboard, and then this extension copies what is on the clipboard and adds it to my [online notepad](https://github.com/lucypero/online-notepad). This way, the last 5 lines displayed on the video are in the notepad. I can then look up any words in there using [Yomichan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami#:~:text=Yomichan%20turns%20your%20browser%20into,EPWING%20and%20flashcard%20creation%20support.). Or add the sentence to Anki
